# Ticket Workflow

Work on ticket: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1. Read the Ticket

First, fetch and understand the ticket:

```
Use the JIRA/Linear MCP tools to:
- Get ticket details (title, description, acceptance criteria)
- Check linked tickets or epics
- Review any comments or attachments
```

Summarize:
- What needs to be done
- Acceptance criteria
- Any blockers or dependencies

### 2. Explore the Codebase

Before coding:
- Search for related code
- Understand the current implementation
- Identify files that need changes

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b {initials}/{ticket-id}-{brief-description}
```

### 4. Implement the Changes

- Follow project patterns (check relevant skills)
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Make incremental commits

### 5. Update the Ticket

As you work:
- Add comments with progress updates
- Update status (In Progress → In Review)
- Log any blockers or questions

### 6. Create PR and Link

When ready:
- Create PR with `gh pr create`
- Link the PR to the ticket
- Add ticket ID to PR title: `feat(PROJ-123): description`

### 7. If You Find a Bug

If you discover an unrelated bug while working:
1. Create a new ticket with details
2. Link it to the current ticket if related
3. Note it in the PR description
4. Continue with original task
